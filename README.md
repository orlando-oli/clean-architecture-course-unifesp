# (UNIFESP) Clean Architecture Course

This project environment was made following my professor's guidelines on the commit messages convention, file structure, naming conventions, and the code style guide, that try to be as close as those shown throughout the course, with minor changes.

As previously suggested, commits here follow http://conventionalcommits.org/ style instead of my own, seen in my other personal projects.
