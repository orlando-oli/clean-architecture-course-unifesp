# (UNIFESP) Clean Architecture Course

This project environment was made following my professor's guidelines with minor changes, including commits, that try to be as close as the ones shown during the course.
As previously suggested, commits here follow http://conventionalcommits.org/ style instead of my own, seen in my other personal projects.
